# Working in tech with a criminal record

I have been working as a software engineer for a few years. Before that I was in prison for a decade. I have talked to several people about working in tech with a criminal record, and I figured I should write this down to avoid repeating myself or missing anything in the future.

I will mostly leave out career advice that applies to everyone, like that your first job in tech is the hardest to get, whether and why you need a degree, etc. This is advice for people with criminal records.

## What you need to know

### First and foremost, do not lie

Never, ever lie. This is generally a good rule, but is especially a good rule when applying for and working at jobs that you actually want to have. If you lie about anything, including your criminal record, you will not get hired or you will get fired. Period. About your record specifically, they can and will find out because they will usually run a background check.

### Don't mention your criminal record unless directly asked

They almost certainly will not ask except during a background check. Any time anyone asks any other question, you want to have an answer that is not related to having a record. You know and I know that "a time when you overcame adversity" means a whole lot of things to a whole lot of people. You've overcome adversity more than once. Pick a time that wasn't related to a criminal conviction in any way; preferably, something business or tech related.

Some people say to just wear their record on their sleeve. I don't agree. In specific places like San Francisco where there are programs that train people in prison for tech jobs, maybe. If you're in one of those programs, ignore my advice. Listen to whoever your program's job placement person is.

For the rest of us: They won't ask about your record when talking to you, and you shouldn't tell them.

### Background checks

Most jobs will run a background check. This will be after your interviews to decide if you seem like you know what you're doing and would be okay to work with. They will directly ask about your criminal record in writing and have you sign a consent form for the background check. You will know when it is happening; it is not a surprise.

There are three things that will definitely keep you from getting hired:

1. If you lie on the background check form.
2. If you have active warrants.
3. If you have a conviction for fraud and are applying to work at a bank or insurance company.

Otherwise, probably the background check will not keep you from getting hired. By the time a company is running the background check, they have already gone through the entire process of deciding you are good enough to work for them and if they deny you for your criminal record they have to start over looking for someone. They don't want to. [(This is also true if you want to negotiate your salary, by the way.)](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/) I don't think anyone outside of HR even sees the background check usually. HR runs it, checks for any red flags they know mean they shouldn't hire you, and then tell the hiring manager, your future boss, yes or no.

I still worry about it every time a background check goes in. It hasn't mattered yet, and I've worked at FAANG, for bigger startups, and for financial institutions. So, probably, usually, the background check won't matter.

I do know one person who actually lost a job offer over a background check. He was the lead programmer maintaining all the programs that kept our state's prison system running. He used to say that he worked for the Man and helped Him find new ways to keep us down. When he got out he had over ten years of experience, and had good references from his old supervisors. He applied for a bunch of jobs fresh from prison, got an offer he didn't want, and then got an offer from a bank (I think Schwab?) which declined him after the background check, and then got an offer from a startup. He's been working at the startup for a year and a half now. I think he bought a house.

You can get denied jobs because of your criminal record, occasionally, it turns out. It did happen to him. It worked out. It kind of didn't matter because if you can get one job offer, you can usually get more than one.

On the off chance they actually want to talk to you about what comes back on your background check, be ready to talk about it. I'd avoid detail and emphasize how much it's behind you, but it's literally never come up for me.

### Security clearances

I know very little about these, but the indirect rumor is that people with criminal records can sometimes get them. I would be extra cautious about any job requiring a security clearance, though. Government work is just a completely different field.

### Fair chance ordinances

You probably don't need to know the details about this. Basically: There are a bunch of laws that tell companies when and how they can background check you and what they can consider during a background check. I'm including it in case, for some reason, this does make a difference for someone.

Many, if not most, tech companies are based in or operate in San Francisco, and must comply with the [San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance](https://sfgov.org/olse/sites/default/files/FileCenter/Documents/11600-Art%20%2049%20Official%20Notice%20Final%20091114.pdf).

If they operate in California but not San Francisco, there's the [California Fair Chance Act](https://calcivilrights.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2022/11/Fair-Chance-Act-FAQ_ENG.pdf).

There is [one for Seattle, too](https://www.seattle.gov/laborstandards/ordinances/fair-chance-employment).

There are lots of software engineers that work for businesses that aren't tech companies. Your local businesses may or may not have a separate fair chance law they have to comply with. On the off chance an employer is violating one of these laws, you are welcome to ask a lawyer if there's anything you can do about it. I would think you're probably out of luck. Generally, companies comply with these laws, even when aren't located somewhere that requires them to. HR guidelines and practices get written to comply with California law, and used everywhere, even if they don't have to.

This tends to be good for you.

### It is really hard to hire software engineers

We don't make good money because there are a lot of people who are really good at this. We make good money because companies need us and there aren't enough of us. If you get through their interview, you've proven that you are good at this and that they need you. They have at least as much to lose, in raw dollars, by turning you down over your criminal record as you do by losing the job offer. Try not to sweat it.
